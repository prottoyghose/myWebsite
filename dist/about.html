            I am currently working as a Senior Software Developer at Nationwide
            Mutual Insurance Company in Columbus, Ohio. I am also pursuing a
            Masters of Science in Computer Science from Franklin University. I
            finished my bachelor of science in Computer Science from Bowling
            Green State University. I love programming becuase it gives me the
            power to turn imaginations into reality. My passion is learning new
            technologies and working on side projects. Apart from work, I love
            listening to songs, hanging out with friends, watching soccer and
            playing FIFA.
